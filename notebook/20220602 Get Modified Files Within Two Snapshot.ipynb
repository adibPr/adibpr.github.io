    "To make my blogging habit a little bit easier, I create a tool to easily convert my jupyter notebooks to markdown that could be parsed into [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), called [pynote2mds3](https://github.com/adibPr/pynote2mds3/) that use `nbconvert` to convert and upload any image into S3. However, I soon find out that I need to manually run this command for each of my new posts and I kind of looking for a way to automate that. The solution is using `make`."

For this blog, I simply create an entry in my makefile to convert all modified/new notebooks to markdown using my tool."

    "But the problem is I need a way to filter files that are only modified, or new in my notebooks directory. We do not want to reprocess all unchanged files. I tried looking for another simple solution, like using Linux command `find` to find all files that are being modified in the last _n_ minutes, but that is still not enough for my need. Then as a challenge, I decided to write a simple script to accomplish that.\n",
