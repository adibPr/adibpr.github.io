      <title>Minimum Actionable Insight: Providing Value as a Data Scientist</title>

      <description>I want to start by stating something not so obvious: not all company needs to add AI to their current business. When we consider the data science hierarchy of needs, AI utilization is placed at the top of the hierarchy, meaning its value will be visible if the other needs below it are accommodated (except of course when AI is the core business). This is true especially if our company is just getting started, or still trying to gain traction.</description>

      <description>Cohort analysis is one of the simple and effective tool to better understand how customer interact in business. We can look whether the customer are coming back, or whether their value are improved over time. A simple tools that should be on every data analytics toolbox. But first, what is a cohort?&#xA;What is cohort? The technical definition of cohort analysis is behavioral analytics that breaks data into relevant groups and observes how their behavior changes over time.</description>

      <description>This is a collaborative event from Thrive of Telkomsel with Data Science Indonesia. In this session, I talked about how we (INDICO) leverage telco data beyond traditional telco business. We explore the benefits of telco data, what it might contains, and what kind of potential application it can do to your business.</description>

      <title>Building Python Layer for AWS Lambda with Docker</title>

      <description>The other day, I was building something with AWS Lambda that requires an additional package. Usually, AWS has provided some scientific packages such as scikit-learn and pandas as a Layer that is ready to use. Unfortunately, one of the packages that I need (seaborn) isn&amp;rsquo;t available yet, so in order to use it in my function, I need to create a Layer manually.&#xA;Usually, this is pretty straightforward, all you need to do is to install the package inside a folder and zip it.</description>

      <description>Last week I got the chance to attend Graph Summit 2023 Jakarta, organized by neo4j. This event discusses the power of the graph database compared to a traditional relational database in terms of complex relations and data queries.&#xA;There are also several presentations regarding the real-world use case from different speakers.&#xA;Influencer Taxes One that is memorable for me is from Mr. Iwan Djuniardi about how the Directorate General of Taxes Indonesia tries to use Graph database to detect potential income of internet influencer, and thus calculating the tax.</description>

      <description>I used to learn something by passively consuming it. Be it by watching a video course, reading a book/article, or looking into tutorials. Most of the time, the knowledge will be lost as soon as I move to learn another thing. So now, I&amp;rsquo;m trying a new thing. Whenever I want to learn something, I must produce something. So instead of passively consuming, I need to actively produce as well.</description>

      <description>The rise of ChatGPT and other large language models is pretty fascinating in the past few months.&#xA;New models are being published with larger model sizes and data, claiming to make an improvement from before.&#xA;Apart from some serious debate on the potential danger of the technology, it surely opens new ways for us to do the things we used to do.&#xA;Since some models are too expensive to run just for fun, I look and tried several models that could be run locally on my computer so I could build something interesting.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a self-hosted person, I own a VPS and have installed some applications that I use in my day-to-day activities. Those apps (like chat server, using Matrix) are becoming a part of my life, and losing the data that&amp;rsquo;s been there will be disastrous for me. Hence, backup is a must thing to do.&#xA;Doing backup isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard, especially if we use the right tools. For the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using borg as a tool for doing backup of all my computer-related data.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a daily writing habit in my note-taking apps (I&amp;rsquo;m currently using Notion, having migrated from Evernote a few months ago). At first, I just write my daily feeling, what negative or positive emotions I currently feel, and the source of them. It helps me meditate on my life. Sometimes I even come up with a good quote or self-advice.&#xA;But writing about feeling alone might be boring sometimes, so I started to look for something different.</description>

      <description>The main idea is we need to know whether this distribution is more likely to happen from another distribution with a level of p. So w need three things:&#xA;The first distribution (base) and its parameter The second distribution (comparator) and its parameter A limit/threshold for which we could safely say this is different. The Z - Test The T-test is for small use case â‰¤ 30, whereas the z-test is for the normal case.</description>

      <description>To make my blogging habit a little bit easier, I create a tool to easily convert my jupyter notebooks to markdown that could be parsed into Hugo, called pynote2mds3 that use nbconvert to convert and upload any image into S3. However, I soon find out that I need to manually run this command for each of my new posts and I kind of looking for a way to automate that. The solution is using make.</description>

      <description>I stumble upon this great tool called matrix-commander that I think is the simplest way to programmatically interact with your Matrix server. I&amp;rsquo;m using these tools in order to send notifications from my server to my matrix room whenever something interesting happens (i.e when my backup is done, or when someone login to my server). It is based on matrix-nio, and only a large single file python. But I found one of the dependencies, libolm, is quite difficult to install (especially in my raspberry pi).</description>

      <description>One common theme from the majority of productivity articles/books that I read is to never let use your brain to store information. Use it to generate new ideas, to solve a problem, to think.&#xA;But here is the thing: Sometimes when you are in a state of deep work, focusing on a task at hand, you might suddenly remember other tasks that you need to do later, or you might get an idea for other things that might not be related to your current task.</description>

      <description>Markdown is a good format to write almost anything. But we as a data scientist, use Jupyter Notebook, a lot. We could do a very rapid experiment, with plot, data frame, etc. This makes me wonder, is it possible to turn a jupyter notes into a blog post? I actually try to do this at my current company, to create some sort of knowledge management platform for our research team.</description>

      <description>This website is built using hand crafted theme as a medium for me to learn Hugo theming. It&amp;rsquo;s not that beauty since I&amp;rsquo;m not a web developer, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so much about hugo and CSS/HTML in general. You can find the code in here.</description>
