      <description>I want to start by stating something not so obvious: not all company needs to add AI to their current business. When we consider the data science hierarchy of needs, AI utilization is placed at the top of the hierarchy, meaning its value will be visible if the other needs below it are accommodated (except of course when AI is the core business). This is true especially if our company is just getting started, or still trying to gain traction.</description>
