      <description>I used to learn something by passively consuming it. Be it by watching a video course, reading a book/article, or looking into tutorials. Most of the time, the knowledge will be lost as soon as I move to learn another thing. So now, I&amp;rsquo;m trying a new thing. Whenever I want to learn something, I must produce something. So instead of passively consuming, I need to actively produce as well.</description>
