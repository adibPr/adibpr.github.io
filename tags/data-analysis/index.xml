      <description>A good understanding of the customer is key to a successful business. Not all customers are created equally. Some (like me), might want the cheapest/free offer, others perhaps willing to pay more to get a premium service, and some might still doubt taking our full offer. Some might be happy with the product and thus keep using it, while others may be on the verge of churning due to various reasons.</description>

      <description>I want to start by stating something not so obvious: not all company needs to add AI to their current business. When we consider the data science hierarchy of needs, AI utilization is placed at the top of the hierarchy, meaning its value will be visible if the other needs below it are accommodated (except of course when AI is the core business). This is true especially if our company is just getting started, or still trying to gain traction.</description>

      <description>Cohort analysis is one of the simple and effective tool to better understand how customer interact in business. We can look whether the customer are coming back, or whether their value are improved over time. A simple tools that should be on every data analytics toolbox. But first, what is a cohort?&#xA;What is cohort? The technical definition of cohort analysis is behavioral analytics that breaks data into relevant groups and observes how their behavior changes over time.</description>
