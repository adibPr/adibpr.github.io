      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good understanding of the customer is key to a successful business.&#xA;Not all customers are created equally. Some (like me), might want the cheapest/free offer, others perhaps willing to pay more to get a premium service, and some might still doubt taking our full offer.&#xA;Some might be happy with the product and thus keep using it, while others may be on the verge of churning due to various reasons.&#xA;Different customer needs different actions and treatments, and segmentation is one way to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But first, what is a cohort?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-cohort&#34;&gt;What is cohort?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The technical definition of cohort analysis is behavioral analytics that breaks data into relevant groups and observes how their behavior changes over time.&#xA;For example, a company might group their user based on their first registration, and observe how their interaction with the platform changes day, week, or month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
