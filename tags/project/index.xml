      <description>To make my blogging habit a little bit easier, I create a tool to easily convert my jupyter notebooks to markdown that could be parsed into Hugo, called pynote2mds3 that use nbconvert to convert and upload any image into S3. However, I soon find out that I need to manually run this command for each of my new posts and I kind of looking for a way to automate that. The solution is using make.</description>

      <description>Markdown is a good format to write almost anything. But we as a data scientist, use Jupyter Notebook, a lot. We could do a very rapid experiment, with plot, data frame, etc. This makes me wonder, is it possible to turn a jupyter notes into a blog post? I actually try to do this at my current company, to create some sort of knowledge management platform for our research team.</description>

      <description>This website is built using hand crafted theme as a medium for me to learn Hugo theming. It&amp;rsquo;s not that beauty since I&amp;rsquo;m not a web developer, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so much about hugo and CSS/HTML in general. You can find the code in here.</description>
