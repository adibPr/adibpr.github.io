      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a self-hosted person, I own a VPS and have installed some applications that I use in my day-to-day activities. Those apps (like chat server, using Matrix) are becoming a part of my life, and losing the data that&amp;rsquo;s been there will be disastrous for me. Hence, backup is a must thing to do.&#xA;Doing backup isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard, especially if we use the right tools. For the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using borg as a tool for doing backup of all my computer-related data.</description>
