      <description>The other day, I was building something with AWS Lambda that requires an additional package. Usually, AWS has provided some scientific packages such as scikit-learn and pandas as a Layer that is ready to use. Unfortunately, one of the packages that I need (seaborn) isn&amp;rsquo;t available yet, so in order to use it in my function, I need to create a Layer manually.
Usually, this is pretty straightforward, all you need to do is to install the package inside a folder and zip it.</description>
